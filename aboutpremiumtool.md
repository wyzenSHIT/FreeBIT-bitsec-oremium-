BITSEC v1700.0: Core Feature Set

    Advanced Reconnaissance & Infiltration

        580+ Specialized Modules: A massive library of validated security vectors tailored for enterprise-grade auditing.

        WAF & IPS Suppression: Intelligent bypass logic designed to evade modern Web Application Firewalls and Intrusion Prevention Systems.

        TLS-Stack Hijacking: Deep analysis and manipulation of secure connections to identify underlying transport layer vulnerabilities.

    The "Father-Son-Grandson" Execution Logic

        Stage 1 (Father): High-level entry, reconnaissance, and initial payload delivery.

        Stage 2 (Son): Deep system penetration, persistence establishment, and host-level access.

        Stage 3 (Grandson): Privilege escalation to ROOT and final data exfiltration.

    Vulnerability & Exploitation Engine

        Zero-Day Auto-Fuzzer: Real-time generation of polymorphic payloads to bypass signature-based detection.

        Massive SQLi Matrix: 25+ unique injection vectors per module with automated database structure harvesting.

        RCE Shell Deployment: Remote Code Execution modules that establish secure, persistent terminal access to target servers.

        Admin Panel Destruction: Automated discovery and brute-force of administrative interfaces with full source code dumping via curl.

    Exfiltration & Reporting

        Real-time Telegram Integration: Instant alerts and logs sent directly to your master ID (8162292192).

        Automated Loot Packaging: Comprehensive data gathering (stolen databases, .env files, config logs) compressed into an encrypted ZIP archive.

        Stealth Purge System: One-click cleanup to remove local logs and traces of the audit after the task is completed.
